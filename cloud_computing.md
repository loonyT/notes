Cloud computing, commonly referred to as the cloud, is the delivery of computing power over the web. This means the cloud service providers provide the infrastructure to the businesses over the web via their user-friendly dashboards and APIs, enabling them to host their services without the need for setting up any sort of infrastructure on their premises.

The infrastructure that is made available to these businesses is typically web servers to run their apps, disk storage to store massive amounts of data, compute-heavy servers for rendering animation, run analytics on Big data, run computational heavy scientific algorithms and so on.

All the information exchanges between the business and the cloud provider happen over the web in an encrypted fashion via an API. We currently live in an API driven world. Everything is API driven and is available as a service powered by an API. There is even a term for this, called Everything as a Service.

In today’s tech landscape, there is a surge of as a Service offerings like Analytics as a Service, Blockchain as a Service, AI as a Service, Games as a Service, Payments as a Service, Monitoring as a Service, Notifications as a Service, and so on.

Today, most of the world is online, and the part that isn’t will eventually be online. And as the consumers move online, the businesses follow. There is a surge in the number of web-based startups emerging in every niche, including mobile gaming, e-commerce, daily commutes, and others.

As the number of startups increases, there is an ever-growing need for the infrastructure they can use to run their services. This requirement is fulfilled by cloud service providers. The gist is that, in today’s tech landscape, the cloud business is booming and is expected to continue to grow at a rapid pace.

Hosting on the cloud: The way forward #
In the present state of the software development universe, I am yet to come across a developer who, after developing their app, says, “Hey, I’ve written this cool app. Now, I have to rush to the computer store, buy some bare metal servers, install Linux, and get them up and running. I guess I should set up everything in my basement. Right?”

Ideally, the next move after developing an application is finding the right platform to host the app. We browse through the web looking for the right cloud platform that fulfills our infrastructure requirements and, of course, fits our budget.

On the contrary, we sometimes even pick the platform or the cloud product first and then build our app using the platform’s APIs. This generally happens when using a PaaS (Platform as a Service) to run our service. PaaS is a cloud service model.

Cloud service providers #
So, as the cloud service industry expands, the cloud service providers continue to onboard more and more businesses, hosting both startups and big enterprises simultaneously.

These businesses prefer to build their products from the bare bones to run on the cloud. Additionally, those that are running legacy workloads on-premises are either planning or in the process of migrating to the cloud with the technical assistance of the service providers. We will talk about what it means to be on-premises, or on-prem, in a later lesson where you’ll be introduced to different cloud deployment models.

Speaking of the big players in the cloud service space, like the AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, have set up massive, highly resilient data centers across the globe over time. They can scale with any kind of load pretty quickly using the plug and play commodity server approach. Over the years, these big companies have mastered the art of running and scaling the cloud infrastructure with minimum downtime.

Here are a few popular services that are scaled with millions of users and deployed on cloud service providers:

Pokémon Go, the augmented reality mobile game that became a phenomenon, was developed by Niantic and hosted on the Google Cloud Platform. According to the Google Cloud blog, right after the launch, the game attracted a massive number of players up to fifty times the anticipated traffic, and it had to scale exponentially to ensure a smooth gaming experience to the players.

Fortnite by Epic Games is an online multiplayer game that runs on AWS servers that handle a load of a whopping two-hundred million players (according to this case study). Fun Fact: two-hundred million is twenty-four times the population of New York City .

Hotstar, a leading streaming media and video-on-demand service in India with a user base of over two-hundred million users, runs its services on the AWS cloud. In the latest edition of the IPL T20 Cricket tournament, the streaming platform received record traffic of 10.3 million concurrent users smashing its previous record of 8.26 million concurrent users. Here is a post on it that I’ve written on my blog.

These cloud providers have achieved economies of scale. They run the services of so many businesses around the world in their data centers that collectively the cost of running a service for a single customer comes down significantly in comparison to the costs associated if the business self-hosts its service on-premises.

Cloud service providers #
As the need for cloud hosting expands, the cloud providers continually upgrade their product offerings to cover all the common infrastructural and technical requirements of the businesses today. As these cloud providers make money, they pour more money into their infrastructure to offer better products, competitive hosting rates, and so on. They enable their customers to focus on the innovation part and let themselves worry about the infrastructure part.

Hosting our service on a public cloud, like AWS or Google Cloud sounds fascinating but there are instances where primarily due to the data security reasons it’s not feasible for businesses, typically in the financial, government, and the legal space, to move their data to a public cloud. They have to resort to local data processing and storage, running everything on-premises.

To provide a solution for this use case, cloud providers offer a service where they assist businesses to set everything up on their premises by extending the cloud provider’s state-of-the-art infrastructure to their premises. Via this offering, a business can leverage the infrastructure of a third-party cloud provider without streaming any kind of data over to their platform. Amazon Outposts is one example of this.

Cloud service providers catering to a specific use case #
We know that user experience and simplicity of use of product are key to the success of any business. Though, in the case of big cloud providers, businesses, not having much technical knowledge of the cloud, often find themselves overwhelmed with so many product offerings and solutions provided by these platforms.

It’s hard to pick the right product from a gamut of product offerings without having the technical expertise of the cloud. To pick the right cloud product, businesses have to either educate themselves or hire a consultant to do the job for them.

To address this inconvenience there are many cloud providers that operate on a smaller scale and cater to specific use cases, like offering a platform only for hosting static sites or a platform focused on building serverless apps.

These providers have simple, easy to use, intuitive interfaces with a limited set of products. There is not so much of a learning curve to deploy our services on these platforms. They offer competitive hosting rates, freemium plans, and so on. They also provide the users custom tools for the platform-specific use cases, streamlining deployments.

It’s hard for big cloud providers to drill down and write extensive custom tooling for every specific use case simply due to the range of services they offer.

The providers that operate on a smaller scale either rent out private data centers or they build their platform on top of a big cloud platform like AWS, extending their infrastructure.

Decentralized cloud #
Besides these big centralized cloud providers, we also have decentralized cloud providers like IExec, Golem, etc. They provide a peer-to-peer, blockchain-powered cloud infrastructure to the businesses for host their services on.

The upside of decentralized cloud platforms is that they pretty much offer you infinite computing power at low rates. That means anyone with a server or even a laptop can plug in their hardware to the decentralized, peer-to-peer computing grid and augment its computing power, making some money simultaneously.

History of cloud #
Companies in the computing hardware business, like IBM, have been renting out computing power via its worldwide data centers to banks and other big corporations since the beginning. IBM made it big with its mainframe servers.

In the year 1999, Salesforce started delivering their software over the web and became a pioneer in cloud computing. Their service was a SaaS (Software as a Service) targeting enterprise customers.

In the year 2006, Amazon released its Elastic Compute Cloud EC2. This was the first cloud computing service available to indie developers and small companies. A couple of years later, in 2008, Google released a beta version of Google App Engine. Google App Engine GAE is Google’s Platform as a Service offering. That year 2010, Microsoft jumped in with its Microsoft Azure cloud platform. In the same year, Rackspace, with NASA, launched an open-source cloud software called the OpenStack.

OpenStack became pretty popular with businesses that wanted to run their services on the cloud but needed everything to be on-premises.

Then, in 2011, IBM came out with its cloud platform called the IBM SmartCloud. The following year Oracle launched Oracle Cloud.

Amazon and Google entered the market with a general-purpose computation offering. *Amazon Web Service (AWS) * had the first-mover advantage, and it still holds its ground today. Presently, has the biggest market share in cloud computing with other players trying to play catchup. AWS has gained the trust of businesses over the years by providing top-notch service and continual innovation.

Speaking of the term cloud, it’s actually more of a branding term and helps with the marketing, as it sounds cool. “Hey!! I have my app running on the cloud.” For a not so technical person, the word “cloud” seems approachable and it won’t intimidate them, as opposed to saying, “Hey why don’t you run your application using distributed systems?”

Wait… What Systems?

However, from a technical standpoint, cloud doesn’t mean anything. Maybe we see the whole World Wide Web as one big cloud and the cloud service providers offer their services over the World Wide Web. So, this can be credited for the origin of the word ”cloud.”

Behind the scenes, it’s the sophisticated distributed systems running on commodity hardware in massive data centers all around the globe that power services running on the cloud. 

WHY TO USE CLOUD?

Economic reasons #
No upfront deployment costs #
I talked a bit about this in the introductory cloud lesson, but with so many businesses onboard cloud providers have achieved economies of scale. As a result, the cost of hosting a single service has come down significantly. So much so that these platforms are able to provide a perpetual free tier of their services to the businesses.

With a free tier, these businesses can experiment a bit to get an idea of whether the cloud service offerings go well with their requirements and test the waters simultaneously. If a service has minimal traffic and its resource consumption remains below a certain threshold, there is literally no hosting charge that the business has to pay.

The upfront deployment costs for a workload is zero. When we host our app on the cloud, there is no need for us to set up our data center before we launch our service. There are no IT costs involved in setting up and managing things. With these cloud platforms, all we have to do is deploy our workload on their infrastructure to go global within minutes without spending a single penny. I mean, how cool is that?

Think about this from an indie developer standpoint. Imagine that I build an augmented reality game like Pokémon Go. With these freemium services, I don’t have to worry much about the app’s hosting costs during the initial days. By leveraging a cloud service, I can bring my idea to reality, show it to the world, have some initial users, get feedback, and pitch it to potential investors without paying a dime for hosting or infrastructure. Well, what more can I say?

This is the whole reason the cloud service model blew up. It provided a way for solo, indie developers to bootstrap their business and get a foothold in the market by just focusing on idea implementation and letting the cloud platform take care of the rest.

Pay as you go pricing model #
All the cloud platforms offer a pay as you go pricing model. There are no long-term contracts, hidden charges, or complex licensing of any sort. It’s just like we pay for our electricity usage. Pay only for what you use. The consumption of computing resources is charged per minute or even seconds. So, if we wish to power down a service, we are charged only for the time the service is up, we don’t have to pay for the entire day or even the next hour. Also, there is no service termination fee involved.

The pay-as-you-go model enables a business to adapt to the traction its product gets. There is no overcommitting money for the infrastructure.

Some cloud providers like AWS also enable businesses to buy reserved instances in advance at a much less price than that of on-demand compute instances. Reserved instances are the compute power at a certain availability zone that businesses can buy for a longer period of time. Reserving computing power brings down the hourly instance price significantly.

Cloud providers also provide a volume discount if a service consumes a large amount of computing power on their platform. This brings down the hosting costs even further for the business. These providers keep coming up with innovative and optimized pricing models to keep businesses happy, onboard, and making good profits at the same time.

These are the economic reasons for using cloud hosting. Now, let’s talk about the technical reasons behind picking a cloud host for our application.

Technical reasons #
Provisioning the right amount of hardware #
No service wants to go down ever, no matter how much traffic load it has to deal with. To handle the traffic bursts, we need to provide the right amount of computing power to tackle the traffic influx at peak times.

When setting up their infrastructure, businesses have to make an estimate of the maximum amount of traffic their platforms could receive, and then they have to go shopping for hardware that can handle that much load. This is technically known as provisioning.

In this scenario, businesses have to buy all the hardware upfront, investing quite a sum of money to get their platforms ready to handle the traffic surge.

Here are a few things to consider when a business buys all the hardware upfront:

What if the platform doesn’t receive the amount of predicted traffic? What if the traffic falls short by quite an extent?

What if there are just a few days in a month when the traffic really spikes, and the rest of the days go pretty normal?

In this scenario, all the extra servers just sit there waiting for the next traffic spike. This is under-utilization and a waste of resources. To handle spikes for a very small amount of time, the business has to spend quite an amount of money upfront.

Let’s consider the opposite scenario.

What if the business blows up right after launch and the platform receives three times the anticipated traffic? How will the modest server fleet handle that amount of traffic?

The servers can’t do much. Rather, they have to salute each other and go down with dignity.

In this situation, the business has to rush to the market to buy new hardware and set everything up quickly, or they will continue to lose customers. On the other hand, they could buy all the hardware upfront like crazy, investing everything they have, anticipating three to five times the estimated traffic.

I ask, what are the odds of a platform getting hit with three to five times the estimated traffic? Unlikely, isn’t it?

Therefore, buying so much hardware upfront is not a practical solution for obvious reasons.

Provisioning instances dynamically on cloud #
With cloud computing, all these scenarios are easily dealt with without the need to invest any money in hardware upfront. When a workload runs on the cloud, additional server nodes get added and removed on the fly based on the traffic patterns.

In the case of a traffic surge, new servers are deployed dynamically to meet the demand. When the traffic subsides, the additional servers that were added dynamically are powered down and removed from the fleet. All this addition and removal of servers happens automatically on the fly without the need for any kind of human intervention. Pretty convenient, isn’t it?

Why make our lives harder, buying and managing all the hardware upfront, when the cloud makes our lives much easier?

A good real-life example of this is Pokémon Go. I brought this up in the first lesson. The Pokémon Go engineering team deployed their augmented reality game on the Google Cloud Platform.

They anticipated a one-time player traffic with a worst-case estimate of five times the anticipated traffic. However, the game blew up right after launch receiving fifty times the anticipated traffic. Google Cloud handled this crazy traffic tsunami, effectively spinning up additional server instances as and when required.

If it wasn’t for the cloud, scaling a service with fifty times the expected traffic was just not possible.


Infrastructure maintenance #

Cloud providers take the onus of everything: server maintenance, security updates, hardware upgrades, and so on.

All that the businesses have to do is focus on writing new features and innovating. There are instances where even big tech companies that can afford a dedicated infrastructure team have migrated their services to the cloud as opposed to running the servers themselves.

The biggest name in this is Twitter. Twitter moved a part of its service to the Google Cloud Platform (click here for details) in 2018.

Additionally, Evernote moved to Google Cloud with over two-hundred million customers and Netflix leverages AWS Cloud to run it’s streaming service.

Data safety #
To prevent loss of data, it needs to be replicated across several data centers across different availability zones around the globe as a contingency for power outages and natural calamities.

Backing up data across the globe in different data centers is not something that every self-hosted business can afford unless it’s a blue-chip stock in the stock market. Calling the entire process expensive would be an understatement.

At the same time losing customer data is not an option. Deploying on the cloud makes our lives easier because the cloud platform backs up our data across several different availability zones for disaster recovery.

Availability of industry-specific, custom solutions and cloud marketplace
Cloud platforms have customers on board from a variety of domains such as Energy, Law, Fintech, Gaming, and so on. These providers offer battle-tested infrastructure for hosting these services, and they are aware of the intricacies of running services for these domains. There are different industry regulations for different domains and compliance with all these regulations and protocols at the infrastructural level is taken care of by the cloud platforms. Businesses do not have to really worry about implementing any of the stuff.

Leveraging distributed systems without having extensive knowledge of them #
Running and managing distributed systems while maintaining a consistent state of an object among thousands of nodes deployed across the globe is something that is not trivial.

To operate distributed systems, we need extensive technical knowledge on the domain, and we really can’t skip this. If we need to scale our service to millions of users, we need to have a distributed backend. Well, the good thing is with cloud platforms we don’t really have to implement anything ourselves, everything is taken care of by the cloud platform. All we need is an API to interact with, which makes our lives a lot easier.



All these migrations to the cloud by giant tech companies are for one simple reason and that is the cloud enables businesses to focus their resources on innovation while having peace of mind with regards to infrastructure maintenance.

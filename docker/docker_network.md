> The network is nothing but an area that allows somebody to reach others with defined permissions and protocols.

- Hostname: This is the most-frequently-used word. Itâ€™s the name of the machine to identify it in a network.

- ping: `ping <hostname>/<ip>` command is used to check the connectivity of machine from the machine from which the command is run.

- subnet: This is a small isolated part of a network. It is like creating boundaries to a particular part in the same network.

- DNS: This is like a phone directory. 
All the reachable hosts are mapped in this domain name service/system using IP and hostname so that you can either reach them by name or IP.

- /etc/hosts: This is the important file. This file has all the reachable hosts with their IP addresses.

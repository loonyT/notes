Orchestration in computing means automated management, coordination, and configuration of software. When running our software, we generally need to leverage orchestration when things get too complex or too big in number to be handled manually.

When we apply orchestration to containers, it’s known as Container orchestration.

Internet services at the scale of Uber, Facebook, and. so on, run thousands of microservices and hundreds of thousands of container instances of those microservices in different regions across the world. Managing such a large number of processes is not trivial and requires serious effort.

This makes container orchestration key in the deployment of microservices in today’s application development landscape. There are several tools available that facilitate this process, including Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Mesos, and so on. Kubernetes is the most popular container orchestration tool used in the industry.

Features of container orchestration tools #
Container orchestration tools help with:

Automatically scaling the containers in different Regions, AZs, and data centers across the world

Load balancing and logically routing traffic to the containers running in different zones

Allocating resources like compute and memory to the containers and monitoring the health of the clusters running the containers

Ensuring container availability based on resource consumption to provision additional container instances in the cluster

Portability of services running in containers, across data centers, and int multi-cloud environments

These are some of the important tasks that container orchestration tools perform.

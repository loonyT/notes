*A web framework* is defined as a package made up of a structure of files and folders of standardized code (HTML, CSS, JS documents, etc.), which can be used to support the development of websites as a basis to start building a site. Essentially, frameworks provide some basic, standard starter code that allows developers to build the meat of their website on.

Most websites share a very similar structure, and the aim of frameworks is to provide this common structure as a starting point so that developers don’t have to redo it from scratch and can reuse the provided code. Frameworks, therefore, serve to simplify the web development process.

# MVC architecture #
Before we introduce some of the common types, frameworks, can be categorized in, let’s discuss the underlying architecture of frameworks. Most, if not all, web application frameworks rely on the Model View Controller architecture. The pattern serves to separate the application logic from the user interface, thus forming the three components that the name is comprised of.

**Model**

The Model stores all information about the content and structure of an application. Upon receiving user input data from the Controller, it communicates any required interface updates to the View component.

**View**

This refers to the application’s front-end, or what is more commonly known as the user interface. It contains information about the layout and the way users can interact with any of its parts. The View receives user input, communicates it to the Controller for processing, and updates itself according to the instructions it, in turn, receives from the Model.

**Controller**

The Controller is an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input from the View, processes it, and mediates required changes between the two.


# Types of frameworks #
There are both front-end and back-end frameworks that are very popularly used, and you may already have heard of them. 
Additionally, there are multiple isomorphic frameworks available that work on both the front-end and the back-end and serve as a bridge between the two.

- Front-end (client-side) frameworks
Angular JS
Bootstrap
React.js
Backbone
Semantic-UI

- Back-end (server-side) frameworks

Express (JavaScript)
Symfony (PHP)
Django (Python)
Ruby on Rails (Ruby)
ASP .NET (C#)

- Isomorphic (client-server) frameworks

Meteor JS
Lazo.js
Rendr

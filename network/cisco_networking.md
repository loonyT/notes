- Aux port: This auxiliary port is used to connect a modem to the router, which can then be used to remotely modify the configuration on the router.

- Attachment Unit Interface (AUI) port: Before the WIC became a standard for providing expansion through an add-on port, 
the AUI allowed transceivers to be used, providing you with the ability to add various types of network connections, such as fiber or copper Ethernet connections.

- Serial: Connects a modem or other serial device to allow a WAN network interface to be used on the router.

- Ethernet/Fast Ethernet/Gigabit Ethernet: Standard network interfaces used to connect different network segments.

- Console: Serial configuration port for command-line access to router management and configuration. Refer to Figure 3-1 to see the console port.

- WAN Interface Card (WIC) port: Because a wide variety of WAN connectivity options are available (for example, T1, ISDN, ADSL), 
you can use this port to add different interfaces to a standard router.

- Hardware WAN Interface Card (HWIC) port: With the integration of services into routers, the WIC interface became too limiting. 
The HWIC interface was created to support a wider variety of hardware expansion options, such as switches and service cards. This port is backward compatible with most older WIC hardware.

- Ethernet - Ethernet is typically Ethernet IEEE 802.3 standard based physical interface, which operates at 10 Mbps speed. The media standard used is 10BaseT.

- Fast Ethernet - Fast Ethernet is typically Ethernet IEEE 802.3u standard based physical interface which operates at 100 Mbps speed. The media standard used is 100BaseT.

- Gigabit Ethernet - Gigabit Ethernet is typically Ethernet IEEE 802.3ab standard based physical interface which operates at 1000 Mbps speed. The media standard used is 1000BASE-T

- Serial - Serial interfaces are typically used for WAN connections from ISP (Internet Service Providers) for connectivity types like Frame Relay, T1, T3, etc.

- FDDI Fiber Distributed Data Interface - FDDI networks operates at 100 Mbps speed and uses a token-passing mechanism to prevent collisions.

- Token Ring - Token Ring interfaces can operate at either 4 Mbps or 16 Mbps. 
In Token Ring networks a token is passed around the network (configured in ring topology), allowing the owner of the token to transmit a frame, to avoid collision.
Token Ring networks vanished from networking industry long way back. New Cisco routers do not have a Token Ring interface.

Note: Only 10Mbps Ethernet interface has a name "Ethernet" in a Cisco Router. A 100Mbps Ethernet interface is called a "FastEthernet" interface and a 1000Mbps Ethernet interface is called a "GigabitEthernet" interface.

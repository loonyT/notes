Security information and event management (SIEM) gives you a comprehensive view of your network 
through a wide lens that which cannot be provided by a single information source or security control.

What is SIEM?
Security information and event management (SIEM) software is a security information system that analyzes security alerts and data 
generated from devices on a network in real time. Organizations use SIEM tools to identify security incidents, log security data, 
manage incident response, and generate reports for compliance.

SIEM combines security information management (SIM), a first generation system that uses long term storage, analysis, and reports of log data; 
and security event management (SEM), a second generation system that includes correlation of events, notifications, real-time monitoring, and console views.

SIEM tools use correlation rules and statistical techniques to convert events and log entries into useful and actionable information.

Key features of a SIEM security solution includes:

- Near-real time visibility—of an organization’s security system through dashboards and other visual aids.
- Data consolidation—from various sources through event log management
- Events correlation—using boolean logic rules to add intelligence to raw data
- Automating security event notifications—analyzes security events and sends alerts to notify issues in real time.

How do SIEM tools work?
The SIEM collects and analyzes log data to detect suspicious activity that may indicate the presence of a threat. This process works in three stages:

- Collect the data—SIEM tools start by collecting and aggregating log data from the network of an organization, 
including security devices, systems, and applications.
- Consolidate and categorize—the system consolidates the logs into categories, separates successful and failed logins, malware activity, 
exploit attempts, and port scans.
- Analyze—these categorized events are contrasted against the preset correlation rules to check if there is suspicious activity.
If there is a discrepancy, the system sends an alert warning of a potential security threat.

SIEM security can identify threats by comparing multiple events, which wouldn’t trigger a security alert if considered by themselves.

Compliance
Organizations can use SIEM tools to comply with regulations for PCI, GDPR, HIPAA, and SOX.

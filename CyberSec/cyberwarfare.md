Cyberspace has become another important dimension of warfare, where nations can carry out conflicts without the clashes of traditional troops and machines. 
This allows countries with minimal military presence to be as strong as other nations in cyberspace. Cyberwarfare is an Internet-based conflict that involves 
the penetration of computer systems and networks of other nations. 
These attackers have the resources and expertise to launch massive Internet-based attacks against other nations to cause damage or disrupt services, such 
as shutting down a power grid.

An example of a state-sponsored attack involved the Stuxnet malware that was designed to damage Iran’s nuclear enrichment plant. Stuxnet malware did 
not hijack targeted computers to steal information. It was designed to damage physical equipment that was controlled by computers. It used modular coding 
that was programmed to perform a specific task within the malware. It used stolen digital certificates so the attack appeared legitimate to the system.

The main purpose of cyberwarfare is to gain advantage over adversaries, whether they are nations or competitors.

A nation can continuously invade other nation’s infrastructure, steal defense secrets, and gather information about technology to narrow the gaps in its industries
and military.
Besides industrial and militaristic espionage, cyberwar can sabotage the infrastructure of other nations and cost lives in the targeted nations. 
For example, an attack can disrupt the power grid of a major city. Traffic would be disrupted. The exchange of goods and services is halted. Patients cannot 
get the care needed in emergency situations. Access to the Internet may also be disrupted. By affecting the power grid, the attack can affect the everyday life 
of ordinary citizens.

Furthermore, compromised sensitive data can give the attackers the ability to blackmail personnel within the government. 
The information may allow an attacker to pretend to be an authorized user to access sensitive information or equipment.

If the government cannot defend against the cyberattacks, the citizens may lose confidence in the government’s ability to protect them. 
Cyberwarfare can destabilize a nation, disrupt commerce, and affect the citizens’ faith in their government without ever physically invading the targeted nation.

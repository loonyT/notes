Cipher mode describes how an algorithm encrypts and decrypts data:

ELECTRONIC CODE BOOK (ECB): blocks of encrypted files.
CIPHER BLOCKCHAINING (CBC)
COUNTER MODE (CTR): allows block ciphers to act more like stream ciphers
Galois/Counter mode adds authentication capability.


Steganography: audio, video, image files...
